# hello-world
This is my first entry on GitHub. I still have no idea what I'm doing, but hopefully that's about to change soon.
Heya humans!

As I first stated, this is all pretty much new to me. I have no idea what I'm doing but I guess learning anything completely new at 28 is a hard ordeal. I have a Bachelors degree in MBA, so this should be a fun ride as it's a compeletely new discipline I'm not at all used to.
